## ✍️ Contributor Guidelines

### Variable Naming Practices

- Use **camelCase** for variables (`userInput`, `formPreview`).
- Prefix IDs and classes with meaningful names (`formInputField`, `copyButton`).
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood (`contactNumber` over `cntNo`).

### Image Naming

- Use descriptive names for images (`form_preview.png`, `resume_example.png`).
- Separate words with **underscores** for readability.

### Commenting Practices

- Use comments to explain why a piece of code exists, not just what it does.
- Start with a clear summary for functions:

```
/**
 * Copies LaTeX code to clipboard.
 * - Retrieves user-entered details.
 * - Populates LaTeX fields.
 * - Executes clipboard copy command.
 */

```

- Inline comments should be concise and address complex or non-obvious logic:

``` Check if PhD details are empty; if so, hide the section. ```

### Code Format

- Indent with 2 spaces.
- Ensure consistent bracket placement:

``` 
if (condition) {
  // Code block
}
```

- Separate logical sections with line breaks for readability.
